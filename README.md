- 👋 Hi, I’m Olivier B. Working as a team lead for GWAM Asia.
- 👀 I’m trying to be a good father, being inclusive, being a good team lead, loosing weight (<-- still failing). 
- 🌱 I’m currently trying to not screw up too much with change management.
- 💞️ I’m looking forward to collaborate on transforming change management to be agile.
- 📫 Well you can probably find a way somewhere on Github.
